Nice to meet you! I'm  a Senior @ UPenn studying Computer Science & Robotics. 

I'm interested in solving problems at scale. I have been involved in research at the distributed systems lab at UPenn building microservice overload control frameworks, and ML for systems and databases. Previously interned at Databricks on ETL systems and data skipping, and at Shoreline / Nvidia on semantic search. 

I enjoy pushing the boundaries of systems, whether they be general compute or ML systems. Would love to connect!
