Hi, I'm Paul!

I'm interested in solving cool systems and ML problems. I currently work on real-time data system syncs at Mooncake Labs. I have been involved in research at the distributed systems lab at UPenn scaling LLM inference to very large scale data. Previously worked on ETL systems and data skipping at Databricks, and at Shoreline / Nvidia on semantic search algorithms. 

Always down to hear more about cool. Would love to connect!
